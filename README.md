This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Food ordering app

This a fictional Pizzaria homepage (underconstruction!!)

Fullstack app using NextJS

MongoBD for data storage and Cloudinay for images uploads

It allows ordering pizzas and choose a payment method (paypal or cash on hands)

It has an admin dashboard that allows CRUD operations as adding, editing and removing pizza,
and also to updated the orders status for pizza tracking.

It uses cookies for authentication
